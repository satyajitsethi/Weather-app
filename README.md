# weather-app

The project consists of a search bar. The user enters the desired city into the input field and clicks on the search button. On hitting the search button we first verify if such a city exists in the database. If no, we display an error message saying – “No city found.”

In case, the city exits, we display the weather information for that particular city. This information includes – City name, temperature, weather icon, maximum temperature, and minimum temperature.

We obtain this information from API. The API that we are using here is – Open Weather API.
